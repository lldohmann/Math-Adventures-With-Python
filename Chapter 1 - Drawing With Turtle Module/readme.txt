This introduces the turtle module, a collection of geometric drawing tools that draws the path of a turtle object on the screen. The turtle acts as a programmablbe robot for the user to send directions to. 

This chapter also introduces the reader to programming concepts like variables (length of sides of a polygon), 
for loops (spiral patterns from multiple shapes), and user defined functions (user must hand write how to draw each 
shape.)

Shapes covered in this chapter are Triangles, Squares, Hexicons, Polygons & the Star.
